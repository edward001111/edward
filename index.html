        <h1>Xiaomi: Chinese smartphone giant takes on Tesla</h1>
        <p>Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has launched its <a href=" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68672192"> electric vehicle (EV) </a> and started taking orders.</p>
        <p>At the event the technology giant's chief executive Lei Jun said the standard SU7 model would be priced at <span class="highlight">215,900 yuan</span> ($29,872; Â£23,663) and the Max version would cost <span class="highlight">299,900 yuan</span>.</p>
        <p>The firm says it got over <span class="highlight">50,000 orders</span> within the first 27 minutes of sales.</p>
        <p>Xiaomi's entry into the electric car market comes as sales growth has slowed globally, triggering a price war.</p>
        <p>The move sees the technology giant taking on EV rivals including Tesla and BYD. The starting price in China for Tesla's Model 3 is <span class="highlight">245,900 yuan</span>.</p>
        <p>Mr Lei also said the SU7, which has drawn comparisons with Porsche's Taycan and Panamera models, would have a minimum range of <span class="highlight">700km</span> (435 miles), beating the Tesla Model 3's <span class="highlight">567km</span>.</p>
        <p>The firm is hoping that the SU7's shared operating system with its phones, laptops and other devices will appeal to existing customers.</p>
        <p>Xiaomi is the third-largest seller of smartphones worldwide with a market share of about <span class="highlight">12%</span>, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p>
        <p>The SU7, which Xiaomi has been teasing since last year, has drawn comparisons to Porsche's Taycan and Panamera sports car models.</p>
        <p>It will be made by a unit of state-owned car manufacturer BAIC Group at a plant in Beijing that can produce as many as <span class="highlight">200,000 vehicles</span> a year.</p>
